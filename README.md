# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview
Jack who we are working with really like an app we worked on, but thinks if we add a few features it will be even better.

This project was launched to understand how the ride-sharing information by city differs, and how that information can be used by V. Isualize (CEO of Pyber) and rest of Pyber team to make decisions based on city type as they navigate the competitive ride sharing market.

Using the analysis we are asked to provide some three recommendations to help improve the PyBer business.

# Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
The first step we need to do to build on this app that users can use to try to choose where they would like to go on vacation based on a temperature range they select, is that we need to get all the information about many cities in the world - we have randomized lattitude and longitute to come up with 5000 random coordinates and where they were close to cities, the information on those cities were collected in a DataFrame, we had just over 700 cities from this excercise.  The information on each city was received via an API from a website call "open weather map" that has information on cities across the world.  This information was required for Deliverable 2.

The urban cities have more rides and drivers, which make sense given the larger population in urban vs. suburban and rural - there are 31x more drivers in urban than in rural and just under 5x more
